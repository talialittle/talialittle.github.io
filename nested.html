    <p class="para">What drills are most effective at improving flexibility demonstartion througout a skill, as well as building the strength needed to enhance skill performance? Below are the name of drills that prove most effective while pointing out which drills dancers tend to most enjoy. 
         As an Acro Director, it is evident in class that weak ankles and tight hamstrings are two of the most common limiting factors. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 50px">Side Aerials</p>

<ul id="widelist"> 
    <li><h3>  Increasing flexibility:</h3> Barrel needle kicks, prep to lunge side aerial needle kicks</li>
    <li><h3> Increasing strength:</h3> Panel mat lunge jumps, AirTrack bounce, pre-side aerial connection jumps</li>
    <li><h3>Critical feedback:</h3> Make sure your dacner swings their arm in front of their leg and drops their chest before jumping</li>
   </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 50px">Front Aerials</p>
    

 <ul id="widelist"> 
    <li><h3>  Increasing flexibility:</h3> Barrel hamstring stretch, standing pike hamstring stretch</li>
    <li><h3> Increasing strength:</h3> Panel mat lunge jumps, pre-front aerial connection jumps, laying front aerial kicks</li>
    <li><h3>Critical feedback:</h3> Make sure your dancer drops their chest before jumping and looks back at the floor while standing up to keep their chest open.</li>
   </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 50px">Back Aerials</p>
 
    <ul id="widelist"> 
        <li><h3>  Increasing flexibility:</h3> Bridge circle stretch  </li>
        <li><h3> Increasing strength:</h3> Back aerial jumps, barrel back aerial kick </li>
        <li><h3>Critical feedback:</h3> Hips are the number one most important factor. Make sure your dancer lifts their hips to the ceiling to create rotation.</li>
       </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 50px">Enjoyment</p>

<ul id="widelist"> 
    <li><h3>  Increasing flexibility:</h3> Hamstring stretch with the barrel, figure four hamstring stretch  </li>
    <li><h3> Increasing strength:</h3> Pre-front and side aerial connection jumps, pannel mat lunge jumps</li>
    <li><h3>Critical feedback:</h3> Dancers do not seem to enjoy the sitting pike stretch. Pike stretch variations such as the figure-four hamstring stretch allow for more enjoyment and better participation.</li>
   </ul>



<p style="font-size: 50px">Tips</p>


<ul id="widelist"> 
    <li><h3>  Have your dancer master the flying cartwheel, as this is the base of a side aerial!</h3>    </li>
    <li><h3>  Stretch hamstrings before attempting any aerial drill to increase motion range and prevent muscle strain!</h3>    </li>
    <li><h3>  Enjoyment comes first. A dancer will experience better progress when fully participating in drills that they enjoy!</h3>    </li>
    <li><h3>  Instructor has a big impact. Enjoyment must come from both sides!</h3>    </li>
</ul>
